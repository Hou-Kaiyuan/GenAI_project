        "response": "Let me analyze the acceleration patterns from the example data and then evaluate the new data.\n\nKey patterns from examples:\n1. 'A': Strong diagonal movements up, then down, with a horizontal stroke in middle\n2. 'B': Vertical down stroke followed by two curved sections\n3. 'C': Single curved movement from top to bottom\n4. 'I': Minimal x-acceleration, strong y-movements for vertical line\n5. 'L': Vertical down stroke followed by horizontal right movement\n6. 'M': Series of up-down movements with strong y-acceleration\n7. 'O': Continuous curved movement returning to start\n8. 'U': Down stroke, curve, up stroke pattern\n\nAnalyzing the new data:\nThe acceleration pattern shows:\n1. Initial upward movement (strong positive y)\n2. Diagonal movement down-right (negative y, positive x)\n3. Complex middle section with multiple direction changes\n4. Strong rightward movement (large positive x)\n5. Final downward movement (negative y)\n\nTop 5 likely matches with confidence scores:\n1. M (85% confidence)\n- Matches the characteristic up-down pattern\n- Similar magnitude of y-acceleration peaks\n- Multiple direction changes typical of M\n- Strong initial vertical movement\n\n2. N (60% confidence)\n- Similar diagonal movements\n- Multiple direction changes\n- Strong vertical components\n\n3. W (45% confidence)\n- Multiple direction changes\n- Similar y-acceleration pattern\n- But lacks some characteristic W features\n\n4. K (30% confidence)\n- Has diagonal components\n- Multiple direction changes\n- But timing pattern differs\n\n5. X (25% confidence)\n- Has crossing movements\n- Similar acceleration magnitudes\n- But stroke order differs\n\nThe most likely prediction is \"M\" because:\n- The pattern shows characteristic peaks in y-acceleration\n- The sequence of movements matches M's up-down-up-down pattern\n- The magnitude and timing of acceleration changes align with example M\n- The x-acceleration pattern shows the slight rightward progression typical of M\n- The overall data length and complexity matches M's multiple strokes"
