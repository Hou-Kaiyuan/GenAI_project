        "response": "I'll analyze the example data first and then predict the given sequence.\n\nKey patterns from examples:\n\n1. A: Shows diagonal strokes (up-right then up-left) with strong Y acceleration for the peak, followed by horizontal stroke\n2. B: Vertical stroke followed by two curved sections, shows alternating X acceleration\n3. C: Single curved stroke with smooth transitions in both X and Y\n4. I: Minimal X acceleration, mainly Y movement for vertical stroke\n5. L: Strong vertical movement followed by horizontal stroke\n6. M: Multiple peaks in Y acceleration, alternating X movements\n7. O: Continuous curved pattern with relatively symmetric X/Y accelerations\n8. U: Smooth downward curve followed by upward curve\n\nAnalyzing the given data:\n\nThe sequence shows:\n1. Initial upward movement (positive Y acceleration)\n2. Multiple peaks and valleys in both X and Y\n3. Strong alternating X accelerations\n4. Complex pattern with multiple direction changes\n5. Large magnitude changes in both axes\n\nLikelihood analysis for all letters:\n- A: 20% - Has some diagonal movements but pattern doesn't match\n- B: 15% - Shows curved sections but not in right pattern\n- C: 5% - Too complex pattern for C\n- D: 10% - Too many direction changes\n- E: 5% - Pattern too complex\n- F: 5% - Doesn't match vertical/horizontal pattern\n- G: 10% - Too many peaks\n- H: 15% - Has vertical and horizontal components\n- I: 0% - Too complex pattern\n- J: 5% - Wrong pattern\n- K: 10% - Has diagonal components\n- L: 5% - Too complex\n- M: 85% - Strong match in pattern\n- N: 40% - Similar diagonal components\n- O: 10% - Not circular enough\n- P: 5% - Wrong pattern\n- Q: 5% - Not circular\n- R: 15% - Has some similar components\n- S: 10% - Too many direction changes\n- T: 0% - Wrong pattern\n- U: 10% - Wrong curve pattern\n- V: 15% - Has diagonal components\n- W: 60% - Similar multiple peaks\n- X: 20% - Has crossing patterns\n- Y: 10% - Wrong pattern\n- Z: 5% - Wrong pattern\n\nTop 5 most likely predictions:\n1. M (85% confidence) - Matches multiple peaks pattern and magnitude\n2. W (60% confidence) - Similar multiple diagonal movements\n3. N (40% confidence) - Has diagonal components\n4. A (20% confidence) - Shows some diagonal patterns\n5. X (20% confidence) - Has crossing movements\n\nFinal prediction: M\nThe pattern strongly matches the example M with multiple peaks in Y acceleration and alternating X movements, characteristic of the three vertical strokes connected by diagonal strokes in the letter M."
