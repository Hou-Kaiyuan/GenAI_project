        "response": "I'll analyze the acceleration patterns and compare them with the example data and typical letter writing motions.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the key patterns in the given data:\n1. Initial small movements followed by negative x acceleration and positive y acceleration\n2. A curved motion pattern with alternating accelerations\n3. Multiple direction changes suggesting multiple strokes\n4. Final pattern shows positive x and y accelerations followed by deceleration\n\nComparing with example data and standard letter writing patterns:\n\nMost likely matches:\n\n1. S (85% confidence)\n- The data shows characteristics highly consistent with writing an \"S\":\n- Initial downward curve (negative x, positive y)\n- Middle section showing reversal (alternating x, y values)\n- Final upward curve (positive x, positive y)\n- Pattern matches the natural flow of writing an S with its two opposing curves\n\n2. C (60% confidence)\n- Similar initial curve pattern\n- But lacks the simple single-curve pattern seen in example C data\n- More complex acceleration changes than typical C\n\n3. G (45% confidence)\n- Similar curved pattern\n- But missing the distinctive horizontal stroke at bottom\n- More vertical movement than typical G\n\n4. B (30% confidence)\n- Has some similar curved patterns\n- But lacks the strong vertical line pattern seen in example B\n- Too many gradual curves\n\n5. P (25% confidence)\n- Shows some curved patterns\n- But missing the clear vertical stroke pattern\n- Too many direction changes\n\nLess likely matches (under 20% confidence):\n- A, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nThese letters show significantly different acceleration patterns:\n- Different stroke counts\n- Different direction changes\n- Different curve patterns\n- Different start/end patterns\n\nTop 5 Summary (with confidence scores):\n1. S (85%)\n2. C (60%)\n3. G (45%)\n4. B (30%)\n5. P (25%)\n\nThe prediction strongly favors \"S\" due to:\n- Matching curved pattern sequence\n- Similar acceleration magnitudes\n- Appropriate number of direction changes\n- Natural flow of acceleration matching S writing motion\n- Consistent with typical S stroke order and shape"
