        "response": "Let me analyze the acceleration patterns from the example data first:\n\nKey patterns observed from examples:\n1. 'A': Strong diagonal movements with a sharp peak, followed by a horizontal stroke\n2. 'B': Vertical line followed by two curved segments, showing alternating x-acceleration\n3. 'C': Single curved movement with smooth acceleration changes\n4. 'I': Minimal x-acceleration, mainly vertical movements\n5. 'L': Strong vertical movement followed by sharp horizontal acceleration\n6. 'M': Multiple peaks in y-acceleration, alternating x-direction\n7. 'O': Continuous curved movement with periodic acceleration pattern\n8. 'U': Smooth downward movement followed by curved bottom and upward stroke\n\nAnalyzing the given data:\n- The x-acceleration values are relatively small (-6 to 4)\n- The y-acceleration shows a pattern of alternating positive and negative values\n- There's a notable negative y-acceleration early (-36)\n- Multiple small oscillations in both x and y\n- The pattern shows several direction changes but not extreme accelerations\n\nLikelihood analysis for all letters:\nHigh probability (>70%):\n- I: Strong match due to minimal x-acceleration and vertical movement pattern\n\nMedium probability (30-70%):\n- T: Similar to I but with horizontal stroke\n- H: Could explain the multiple vertical movements\n- F: Matches the vertical and small horizontal patterns\n\nLow probability (10-30%):\n- E: Some similarity in horizontal strokes\n- L: Partial match in vertical movement\n\nVery low probability (<10%):\n- All other letters (A,B,C,D,G,J,K,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) show significantly different acceleration patterns\n\nTop 5 most likely predictions:\n1. I (85% confidence) - Best match with example data and movement pattern\n2. T (65% confidence) - Similar vertical movement with horizontal component\n3. H (45% confidence) - Multiple vertical movements could fit\n4. F (40% confidence) - Vertical and horizontal strokes align\n5. E (25% confidence) - Some matching horizontal patterns\n\nThe most likely prediction is \"I\" due to:\n- Minimal x-axis acceleration variation\n- Consistent vertical movement pattern\n- Similar acceleration magnitudes to example 'I' data\n- Lack of strong curved or diagonal movements\n- Overall movement simplicity matches 'I' characteristics"
