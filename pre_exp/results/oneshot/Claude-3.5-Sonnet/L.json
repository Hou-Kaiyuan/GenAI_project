        "response": "Let me analyze the acceleration patterns in the example data first, then compare them with the test data.\n\nKey patterns from examples:\n1. 'A': Strong diagonal movements (up-right then up-left), with a horizontal stroke\n2. 'B': Vertical line followed by two curved sections with strong x-axis variations\n3. 'C': Single curved movement with strong negative then positive x-acceleration\n4. 'I': Minimal x-acceleration, mainly vertical movements\n5. 'L': Vertical movement followed by sharp horizontal acceleration\n6. 'M': Series of strong y-axis alternations with moderate x-movement\n7. 'O': Continuous curved movement with balanced x and y accelerations\n8. 'U': Down-curve-up pattern with symmetric acceleration profile\n\nAnalyzing the test data:\nThe pattern shows:\n1. Initial small movements\n2. Moderate negative y-acceleration (-24 peak)\n3. Oscillating pattern in middle section\n4. Strong positive x-acceleration near end (peak around 35)\n5. Relatively smooth finish\n\nLikelihood analysis for all letters:\nHigh probability (>70%):\n- C: Strong match with initial downward curve and final rightward movement\n\nMedium probability (30-70%):\n- G: Similar to C but with added horizontal stroke\n- E: Could match if written with curved strokes\n- S: Has similar oscillating pattern but typically more pronounced\n\nLow probability (10-30%):\n- O: Missing the complete circular pattern\n- Q: Missing the distinctive tail movement\n- D: Lacks the strong vertical component\n\nVery low probability (<10%):\n- A, B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z: Movement patterns significantly different\n\nTop 5 most likely predictions:\n1. C (85% confidence) - Best matches the overall acceleration pattern\n2. G (65% confidence) - Similar to C with added complexity\n3. E (45% confidence) - Could match if written with curved strokes\n4. S (35% confidence) - Similar oscillating pattern\n5. O (25% confidence) - Some curved elements match but missing full circular pattern\n\nThe most likely prediction is the letter \"C\" due to:\n- Similar initial downward acceleration\n- Comparable curved movement pattern\n- Matching rightward acceleration at completion\n- Overall acceleration magnitude alignment with example C data"
