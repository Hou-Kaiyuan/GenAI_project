'A': Strong diagonal movements with a crossbar, showing high Y acceleration initially (upward), then negative Y (downward), with varying X accelerations\n2. 'B': Vertical line followed by two curved sections, showing strong X acceleration changes\n3. 'C': Single curved motion, showing gradual acceleration changes in both X and Y\n4. 'I': Minimal X acceleration, mainly Y movement for vertical line\n5. 'L': Vertical line followed by horizontal base, showing distinct acceleration pattern\n6. 'M': Multiple peaks in Y acceleration, showing up-down movements\n7. 'O': Continuous curved motion with relatively symmetric acceleration patterns\n8. 'U': Downward curve followed by upward movement\n\nAnalyzing the new data:\nThe acceleration pattern shows:\n1. Initial strong positive Y acceleration (upward movement)\n2. Multiple peaks and valleys in Y acceleration\n3. Alternating X acceleration patterns\n4. Final upward movement with positive Y acceleration\n\nThis pattern most closely matches characteristics of:\n\nTop 5 likely matches:\n1. M (80% confidence) - The multiple peaks in Y acceleration and alternating X movements strongly match M's characteristic pattern\n2. N (60% confidence) - Similar to M but with fewer peaks\n3. W (40% confidence) - Inverse pattern possibility but less likely\n4. V (30% confidence) - Some similar characteristics in diagonal movements\n5. K (20% confidence) - Similar sharp direction changes\n\nThe strongest evidence points to 'M' because:\n- The initial upward movement matches M's first stroke\n- The multiple peaks in Y acceleration correspond to M's up-down-up-down pattern\n- The X acceleration alternates as expected for the diagonal strokes of M\n- The final acceleration pattern matches the completion of M's last stroke\n\nOther letters (A-Z) have significantly lower probability due to:\n- Not matching the multiple peak pattern\n- Different acceleration magnitudes\n- Incompatible stroke patterns\n- Missing characteristic features of their standard writing motions\n\nThe data most strongly suggests this is the letter 'M' with high confidence, as it matches both the learned example pattern and the expected acceleration profile for writing an uppercase M."
