        "response": "I'll analyze the acceleration patterns from the example data and then evaluate the new data.\n\nKey patterns from examples:\n1. 'C': Shows a curved motion with strong negative x-acceleration followed by positive, matching the counter-clockwise arc\n2. 'O': Exhibits a full circular pattern with alternating x/y accelerations\n3. 'L': Shows minimal acceleration in vertical stroke, strong horizontal acceleration at bottom\n4. 'U': Shows downward acceleration, curved bottom, upward acceleration\n5. 'M': Strong y-axis oscillations for peaks and valleys\n6. 'B': Complex pattern with strong vertical stroke and two curved sections\n7. 'I': Minimal x-acceleration, mainly vertical movements\n8. 'A': Diagonal strokes with strong accelerations in both axes\n\nAnalyzing the new data:\nThe pattern shows:\n1. Initial positive y-acceleration\n2. Curved motion with negative x-acceleration\n3. Smooth transition to positive x-acceleration\n4. Final curved section with alternating accelerations\n5. Returns to starting position\n\nThis pattern most closely matches characteristics of:\n\nHigh probability matches:\n1. C (90% confidence) - The acceleration pattern strongly matches the C example with:\n   - Initial curved motion\n   - Strong negative x-acceleration followed by positive\n   - Similar magnitude and timing of accelerations\n\n2. G (70% confidence) - Similar to C but with extra movement at end\n\n3. O (60% confidence) - Similar curved pattern but lacks complete closure\n\n4. S (40% confidence) - Has curved elements but different sequence\n\n5. D (30% confidence) - Similar initial pattern but different ending\n\nLower probability matches (10-20%):\n- E, F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z: These letters have significantly different stroke patterns and acceleration signatures\n- B: Too complex pattern compared to data\n- A, I, L, M: Very different movement patterns\n\nTop 5 most likely predictions:\n1. C (90%)\n2. G (70%)\n3. O (60%)\n4. S (40%)\n5. D (30%)\n\nThe strongest prediction is 'C' due to the very close match in acceleration pattern, magnitude, and timing with the example C data."
