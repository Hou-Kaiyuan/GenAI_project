        "response": "Let me analyze the acceleration patterns from the example data and then evaluate the new data:\n\nKey patterns from examples:\n1. 'A': Strong diagonal movements with a sharp center crossbar\n2. 'B': Vertical line followed by two curved segments\n3. 'C': Single curved movement from top to bottom\n4. 'I': Minimal x-acceleration, strong y-movements for top/bottom bars\n5. 'L': Strong vertical movement followed by horizontal base\n6. 'M': Series of sharp peaks in y-acceleration\n7. 'O': Continuous curved movement returning to start\n8. 'U': Downward movement followed by curved bottom and upward stroke\n\nAnalyzing the new data:\nThe pattern shows:\n1. Initial small movements\n2. Strong negative y-acceleration (-39) indicating downward movement\n3. Significant positive x-acceleration (31-38) in middle section\n4. Positive y-acceleration (29-38) indicating upward movement\n5. Gradual return to neutral with smaller oscillations\n\nLetter-by-letter analysis:\n- C: High match (90%) - The pattern strongly resembles the C example with:\n  * Initial downward curve (negative y)\n  * Rightward movement (positive x)\n  * Upward curve (positive y)\n  * Similar magnitude and sequence of accelerations\n\n- G: Moderate match (70%) - Similar to C but missing characteristic tail\n\n- O: Moderate match (60%) - Similar curved pattern but doesn't complete the full circle\n\n- D: Low match (40%) - Has curve but missing strong vertical line\n\n- Q: Low match (35%) - Similar to O but missing distinctive tail\n\nOther letters show significantly lower correlation with the acceleration pattern.\n\nTop 5 most likely predictions:\n1. C (90% confidence) - Strongest match to example pattern\n2. G (70% confidence) - Similar but with slight variations\n3. O (60% confidence) - Shares curved pattern\n4. D (40% confidence) - Partial match\n5. Q (35% confidence) - Partial match\n\nFinal prediction: The letter is most likely \"C\" based on the very close match to the example C pattern, particularly in the sequence and magnitude of accelerations in both x and y directions."
