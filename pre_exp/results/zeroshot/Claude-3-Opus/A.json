        "response": "Here is my detailed analysis of the possible uppercase letter matches based on the provided acceleration data:\n\nA (60% confidence): The data shows an initial downward stroke followed by an upward diagonal stroke to the right, which matches the typical motion of writing an uppercase A. However, the data doesn't clearly show the final crossbar stroke of the A.\n\nB (20%): There is a possible vertical downstroke and a loop motion, but the distinct double loop of a B is not clearly represented in the acceleration sequence.\n\nC (30%): The data shows a possible curved stroke, but it lacks the clear semicircular motion typical of an uppercase C.\n\nD (25%): There is a possible vertical downstroke and a curved stroke, but the distinct loop of the D is not clearly captured.\n\nE (40%): The data shows potential vertical and horizontal strokes that could match an E, but the typical stroke sequence is not definitively represented.\n\nF (35%): The vertical stroke and potential horizontal strokes could indicate an F, but the upper horizontal stroke is not distinctly captured.\n\nG (20%): While there are curved and diagonal strokes, the data doesn't closely match the semicircular stroke and downward tail of a G.\n\nH (45%): The data shows two potential vertical strokes with a connecting horizontal stroke, which aligns with the structure of an uppercase H. However, the horizontal stroke is not as distinctly represented as would be ideal.\n\nI (15%): The data does not show a strong match for the simple vertical stroke of an I.\n\nJ (10%): The curved and downward strokes do not closely align with the shape of an uppercase J.\n\nK (55%): The data shows a strong vertical stroke followed by diagonal strokes, which matches the typical motion of writing an uppercase K. The angles of the diagonal strokes are not perfectly clear but overall this is a good potential match.\n\nL (30%): The vertical stroke is present but the distinct right angle of the horizontal stroke is not clearly captured.\n\nM (25%): While there are multiple vertical and diagonal strokes, the data does not closely match the sequence of strokes in an uppercase M.\n\nN (35%): The vertical and diagonal strokes show potential for an N shape, but the angles and stroke order are not a definitive match.\n\nO (20%): The data shows some curved motion but does not capture the full circular stroke typical of an uppercase O.\n\nP (25%): There is a possible downward stroke and a curved stroke, but the distinct loop of the P is not clearly represented.\n\nQ (15%): The acceleration sequence does not closely match the strokes of an uppercase Q.\n\nR (50%): The data shows a vertical stroke and diagonal strokes similar to an uppercase R. The final downward stroke is not distinctly captured but overall this is a potential match.\n\nS (20%): While there are some curved strokes, the data does not closely match the distinct S shape.\n\nT (30%): The strong vertical stroke is present but the horizontal cap stroke is not clearly represented.\n\nU (25%): The curved downward strokes show some potential for a U shape but are not a definitive match.\n\nV (40%): The data shows downward diagonal strokes that could match a V shape, but the intersection point is not sharply defined.\n\nW (30%): While there are multiple diagonal strokes, the data does not closely match the distinct peaks and valleys of an uppercase W.\n\nX (45%): The data shows intersecting diagonal strokes that align with the typical strokes of an uppercase X. The intersection point could be more distinct but this is a good potential match.\n\nY (35%): The downward diagonal strokes show potential for a Y shape but the vertical stroke is not clearly represented.\n\nZ (20%): The acceleration sequence does not closely match the distinct zigzag strokes of an uppercase Z.\n\nTop 5 most likely guesses:\n1. A (60% confidence) \n2. K (55%)\n3. R (50%)\n4. H (45%) \n5. X (45%)\n\nBased on my analysis, the acceleration data most likely represents the uppercase letter A, with a 60% confidence score. The data shows an initial downward stroke followed by an upward diagonal stroke to the right, which matches the typical motion of writing an uppercase A. Letters K, R, H, and X are also potential matches with similar stroke patterns, but the overall acceleration sequence aligns best with the shape and stroke order of an uppercase A."
