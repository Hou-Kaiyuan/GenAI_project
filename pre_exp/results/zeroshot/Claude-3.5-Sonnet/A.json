        "response": "Let me analyze this acceleration data pattern and provide a detailed interpretation:\n\nKey Pattern Analysis:\n1. Initial small movements followed by sharp upward acceleration (Y-axis positive peaks)\n2. Multiple direction changes with significant negative Y accelerations\n3. Strong lateral movements (X-axis variations)\n4. Final sequence shows deceleration to completion\n\nLetter-by-Letter Analysis (Top candidates with confidence scores):\n\nM (85% confidence):\n- Pattern strongly matches the standard \"M\" writing sequence\n- Initial upward stroke (high Y acceleration)\n- Two clear V-shaped patterns in middle (alternating X and Y accelerations)\n- Final upward stroke\n- The timing and magnitude of direction changes align with M's characteristic shape\n\nN (65% confidence):\n- Similar initial upward movement\n- Has diagonal and vertical components\n- But lacks the second peak characteristic of M\n\nW (45% confidence):\n- Similar alternating pattern\n- But acceleration magnitudes don't match typical W formation\n- Would expect more pronounced bottom peaks\n\nV (30% confidence):\n- Some similar diagonal movements\n- Lacks the symmetry typically seen in V\n\nA (25% confidence):\n- Has some diagonal components\n- But missing the characteristic horizontal stroke pattern\n\nTop 5 Most Likely Letters:\n1. M (85% confidence)\n2. N (65% confidence)\n3. W (45% confidence)\n4. V (30% confidence)\n5. A (25% confidence)\n\nPrimary Reasoning for M as Top Choice:\n1. The initial positive Y acceleration matches the first vertical stroke\n2. The alternating X and Y accelerations match the three peaks of M\n3. The magnitude and timing of direction changes align with M's standard writing pattern\n4. The final deceleration pattern matches completing the last vertical stroke of M\n5. The overall sequence length and pattern complexity matches what we'd expect for writing M\n\nThe data shows clear evidence of three major directional changes with appropriate acceleration patterns for the three peaks of an \"M\", making it the most probable letter represented by this acceleration data."
