        "response": "Let me analyze this acceleration data sequence to identify the most likely uppercase letter:\n\nKey Pattern Analysis:\n1. Initial movement shows small accelerations (setup position)\n2. Strong negative Y acceleration (-12 to -24) indicating downward stroke\n3. Complex middle sequence with alternating X and Y accelerations\n4. Large positive Y values (20-26) suggesting upward movement\n5. Final sequence shows high X acceleration (35, 14-19) with minimal Y movement\n\nLetter-by-Letter Analysis (Top candidates):\n\nM (Highest Probability - 85%):\n- Initial downstroke matches the first leg of M\n- Alternating accelerations match the V-shaped middle\n- Upward acceleration matches the third stroke\n- Final rightward movement matches the last leg\n- Pattern very consistent with standard M writing motion\n\nN (Second Probability - 60%):\n- Similar pattern but missing the characteristic middle diagonal complexity\n- Final sequence doesn't quite match N's ending\n\nW (Third Probability - 40%):\n- Similar alternating pattern but wrong direction of final strokes\n- Missing characteristic bottom points\n\nK (Fourth Probability - 30%):\n- Some similar acceleration patterns\n- Missing characteristic diagonal stroke patterns\n\nH (Fifth Probability - 25%):\n- Initial downstroke matches\n- Missing characteristic horizontal middle stroke pattern\n\nLower Probability Matches:\n- V, A, Y (15-20%): Some similar diagonal movements but wrong sequence\n- B, D, P, R (10-15%): Different stroke patterns\n- Other letters (<10%): Significantly different patterns\n\nTop 5 Most Likely Letters:\n1. M (85% confidence)\n2. N (60% confidence)\n3. W (40% confidence)\n4. K (30% confidence)\n5. H (25% confidence)\n\nPrimary reasoning for M as top choice:\n1. The initial setup followed by strong downward acceleration matches M's first stroke\n2. The alternating X-Y accelerations match the middle V-shape of M\n3. The upward acceleration sequence matches the third stroke\n4. The final rightward acceleration pattern matches M's final leg\n5. The timing and sequence of accelerations closely match natural M writing motion\n\nThe data shows strongest correlation with the standard writing pattern of an uppercase M, with distinctive features that separate it from other similar letters like N or W."
