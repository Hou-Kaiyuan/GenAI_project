        "response": "Let me analyze this acceleration data sequence to identify the most likely uppercase letter:\n\nKey Pattern Analysis:\n1. Initial Movement: Small acceleration followed by strong positive Y acceleration and moderate positive X, suggesting an upward-right diagonal stroke\n2. Middle Sequence: Shows significant negative X acceleration followed by positive X acceleration with varying Y values, indicating curved or changing direction movements\n3. Final Sequence: Multiple alternating accelerations in both X and Y, suggesting finishing strokes with some complexity\n\nLetter-by-Letter Analysis:\n\nHigh Probability Matches (>70% confidence):\n- M: 85% confidence\n  * The initial upward movement matches M's first stroke\n  * The alternating X accelerations align with M's up-down-up pattern\n  * The final sequence matches completing M's last vertical stroke\n\nModerate Probability Matches (40-70% confidence):\n- N: 65% confidence\n  * Similar to M but missing one peak in acceleration pattern\n- W: 60% confidence\n  * Inverse pattern of M, but acceleration sequence less consistent\n- K: 45% confidence\n  * Some patterns match the diagonal strokes\n  * Missing clear vertical stroke pattern\n\nLow Probability Matches (20-40% confidence):\n- A: 35% confidence\n  * Initial diagonal movement matches\n  * Missing clear crossbar pattern\n- V: 30% confidence\n  * Some diagonal patterns match\n  * Missing symmetry in acceleration\n\nVery Low Probability (<20% confidence):\n- All other letters show significantly different acceleration patterns\n\nTop 5 Most Likely Letters:\n1. M (85% confidence)\n2. N (65% confidence)\n3. W (60% confidence)\n4. K (45% confidence)\n5. A (35% confidence)\n\nPrimary Conclusion: The letter is most likely \"M\" based on:\n1. Clear initial upward stroke\n2. Distinct pattern of alternating X accelerations matching M's peaks\n3. Consistent Y acceleration patterns matching the up-down-up movement\n4. Final deceleration pattern matching M's completion\n5. Overall sequence length and complexity matching M's multiple strokes"
