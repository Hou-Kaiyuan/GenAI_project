        "response": "Let me analyze this acceleration data pattern to identify the most likely uppercase letter:\n\nKey Pattern Analysis:\n1. Initial Movement: Small fluctuations in x with significant negative y acceleration (-39), suggesting a downward stroke\n2. Middle Section: Large positive x acceleration (peaks at 38) with positive y movement, indicating a strong diagonal upward stroke\n3. Final Section: Negative x values with varying y values, followed by settling to near zero\n\nLetter-by-Letter Analysis:\n\nHigh Probability Matches (>70% confidence):\n- N (85%): The pattern strongly matches the standard N writing pattern:\n  * Down stroke (initial negative y)\n  * Diagonal upstroke (strong positive x and y)\n  * Final downstroke (negative x values)\n\nModerate Probability Matches (40-70% confidence):\n- M (65%): Similar pattern but usually has one more peak\n- K (60%): The diagonal strokes could match, but timing is slightly off\n- R (55%): The upper curve and diagonal leg could create similar patterns\n- A (50%): The diagonal strokes could match but lacks clear crossbar signal\n\nLow Probability Matches (10-40% confidence):\n- V (35%): The diagonal strokes could match but timing is wrong\n- X (30%): Similar diagonal movements but wrong sequence\n- W (25%): Similar patterns but would need more peaks\n- Y (20%): Initial pattern matches but lacks clear fork\n\nVery Low Probability (<10%):\n- B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, P, Q, S, T, U, Z: The acceleration patterns don't match these letters' typical writing motions\n\nTop 5 Most Likely Letters:\n1. N (85% confidence)\n2. M (65% confidence)\n3. K (60% confidence)\n4. R (55% confidence)\n5. A (50% confidence)\n\nFinal Prediction: N\nThe data most strongly suggests the letter N due to:\n1. Clear initial downstroke\n2. Strong diagonal upward movement\n3. Final downward movement\n4. Timing and magnitude of accelerations match standard N writing pattern\n5. Pattern completion matches typical N writing duration"
