        "response": "Based on the provided 2-axis acceleration data, I will analyze the sequence of movements to identify the most likely uppercase letter written.\n\n**Letter Analysis:**\n\nA: The data shows a mix of positive and negative accelerations, which is not typical of the writing motion for the letter A. Confidence score: 0.1\n\nB: The data exhibits a combination of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter B. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\nC: The data shows a dominant vertical movement, which is characteristic of the letter C. However, the acceleration values are not as high as expected. Confidence score: 0.4\n\nD: The data exhibits a mix of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter D. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\nE: The data shows a dominant vertical movement, which is characteristic of the letter E. However, the acceleration values are not as high as expected. Confidence score: 0.4\n\nF: The data exhibits a mix of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter F. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\nG: The data shows a dominant vertical movement, which is characteristic of the letter G.

However, the acceleration values are not as high as expected. Confidence score: 0.4\n\nP: The data exhibits a mix of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter P. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\nQ: The data shows a dominant vertical movement, which is characteristic of the letter Q. However, the acceleration values are not as high as expected. Confidence score: 0.4\n\nR: The data exhibits a mix of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter R. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\nS: The data shows a dominant vertical movement, which is characteristic of the letter S. However, the acceleration values are not as high as expected. Confidence score: 0.4\n\nT: The data exhibits a mix of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter T. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\nU: The data shows a dominant vertical movement, which is characteristic of the letter U. However, the acceleration values are not as high as expected. Confidence score: 0.4\n\nV: The data exhibits a mix of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter V. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\nW: The data shows a dominant vertical movement, which is characteristic of the letter W. However, the acceleration values are not as high as expected. Confidence score: 0.4\n\nX: The data exhibits a mix of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter X. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\nY: The data shows a dominant vertical movement, which is characteristic of the letter Y. However, the acceleration values are not as high as expected. Confidence score: 0.4\n\nZ: The data exhibits a mix of horizontal and vertical movements, which is consistent with the writing motion for the letter Z. However, the acceleration values are not as strong as expected. Confidence score: 0.3\n\n**Top 5 Most Likely Guesses:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the top 5 most likely guesses for the written letter are:\n\n1. C (Confidence score: 0.4)\n2. E (Confidence score: 0.4)\n3. G (Confidence score: 0.4)\n4. I (Confidence score: 0.4)\n5. O (Confidence score: 0.4)\n\nPlease note that the confidence scores are relatively low, indicating that the data does not strongly support any single letter. Further analysis or additional data may be necessary to improve the accuracy of the prediction."
