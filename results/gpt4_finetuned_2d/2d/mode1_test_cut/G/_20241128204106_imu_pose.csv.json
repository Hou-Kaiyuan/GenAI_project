This stability suggests that the motion occurs primarily in a 2D plane, indicating minimal vertical movement.\n- **Focus on 2D Motion:** Given the stability, our primary focus will be the x and y axes.\n\n### X-Axis Analysis\n- **Peaks and Valleys:** The x-axis data exhibits several distinct peaks and troughs.\n  - **Initial Increase:** Starting at approximately 0.794, there is a steady increase to around 1.981, indicating a rightward movement.\n  - **Sharp Decrease:** Following this peak, there's a rapid descent to around -2.52, suggesting a significant leftward motion.\n  - **Fluctuations with Diminishing Amplitude:** The x values then continue with smaller oscillations between positive and negative, indicating ongoing lateral movement.\n\n### Y-Axis Analysis\n- **Fluctuating Patterns:** The y-axis shows fluctuations that complement the x-axis data.\n  - **Negative Values:** Initially, values are slightly negative, indicating a slight downward motion.\n  - **Increase to Positive Values:** Thereâ€™s a rise to positive values around 3.942, suggesting an upward motion.\n  - **Cyclic Nature:** The y values oscillate between negative and positive, corresponding with circular motion.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Circular Pattern:** The combined data from the x and y axes outline a circular motion characterized by lateral swings and vertical oscillations. This pattern suggests the formation of a circular shape.\n- **Stability of Z-Axis:** The stability of the z-axis supports the 2D nature of this motion, as expected when drawing a circle on a flat plane.\n\nBased on this analysis of the accelerometer data, we conclude that the motion corresponds to drawing the letter \"O\" due to the observed cyclic patterns and stable z-axis values."
