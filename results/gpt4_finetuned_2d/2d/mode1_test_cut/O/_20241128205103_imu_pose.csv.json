This allows us to focus on the x and y axes.\n\n### X and Y Axes Analysis\n\n#### Initial Observations:\n1. **Vertical Motion (x-axis):**\n   - The x-axis data shows a notable decrease from approximately -0.2 to -4.0. This indicates a strong downward motion, suggesting a significant vertical component.\n\n2. **Horizontal Motion (y-axis):**\n   - The y-axis data remains relatively constant between -0.3 and 0.3, indicating minimal left or right movement. This stability suggests the predominance of a vertical component in the motion.\n\n#### Peaks and Troughs:\n- In the y-axis, there are minor fluctuations, but they do not indicate any significant curve or horizontal movement, which reinforces the vertical nature of the motion.\n- The x-axis data reveals a downward trend with a sharp decrease and an eventual return toward the baseline, which is characteristic of a definitive stroke element.\n\n#### Stable Regions:\n- Both x and y axes show relatively stable regions before and after the major changes, indicating a pause or preparation before and after a significant motion.\n\n### General Observations on Motion:\n- **x-axis:** The sharp downward movement suggests a strong vertical stroke.\n- **y-axis:** The minimal horizontal deviation supports the focus on a predominantly vertical motion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the accelerometer data:\n- The significant decrease in the x-axis data aligns with a vertical stroke.\n- The minimal variation in the y-axis indicates a lack of horizontal movement, suggesting a straight vertical line.\n\nThese characteristics collectively indicate the presence of a simple, vertical stroke, leading to the conclusion that the motion pattern corresponds to the letter \"I\"."
