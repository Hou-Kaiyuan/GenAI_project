The minimal movement on the z-axis confirms that the motion is primarily in 2D, supporting our focus on the x and y axes. The consistent rise and fall in the y-axis, along with the sharp change and stabilization in the x-axis, suggest the formation of the letter \"J.\" The initial stroke, along with a slight curve depicted by x-axis changes, closely matches the structural elements of the letter \"J.\""
