This consistency suggests that the motion occurs predominantly in a plane orthogonal to the gravitational force, indicating minimal vertical movement. The drops and rises are relatively minor compared to the 9.8 m/sÂ² gravitational constant, reinforcing the presence of mainly 2D motion with minimal 3D interaction.\n\n#### Examination of x-axis and y-axis Patterns\n\nFocusing on the 2D motion captured along the x and y axes, we identify specific patterns and features that reveal the structure of the motion.\n\n- **X-axis:**\n  - The initial values are small and positive but increase, indicating horizontal movement.\n  - There is a peak observed around values reaching 2 before decreasing, which signifies a direction change.\n  - The values then become negative, showing a consistent but slight decrease, which suggests a partial loop or return motion.\n  - As the values transition from negative back to positive, this indicates the completion of a rounded motion.\n\n- **Y-axis:**\n  - The y-axis shows high positive values at the start that gradually increase, indicating vertical movement.\n  - A steep drop follows, with values turning negative, suggesting a downward stroke.\n  - The values return to positive as they rise back towards the starting level, indicating another directional change.\n  - Small oscillations appear throughout the data, reflecting minor adjustments to the path.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observed patterns in the accelerometer data suggest a motion characteristic of the letter \"P\":\n\n- The initial rise in the x-values, combined with the stable, high y-values, corresponds to the vertical stroke.\n- The x-axis peak and subsequent return to negative values, along with the y-axis drop and rise, depict the semicircular loop.\n- The minor fluctuations and directional changes are typical of the adjustments needed to form the curved loop.\n\nOverall, the data reveals motion consistent with drawing the letter \"P,\" considering the peaks, troughs, and transitions present in both the x and y axes."
