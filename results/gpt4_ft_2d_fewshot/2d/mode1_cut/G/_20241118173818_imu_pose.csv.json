This stability indicates that the motion is primarily two-dimensional, allowing us to focus on the x and y axes for further analysis.\n\n### X-Axis Analysis\n1. **Initial Stability**: The x-axis starts with stable values around -0.206 to -0.196, suggesting the beginning of a motion sequence, likely a starting point for a larger curve.\n2. **Increase in Values**: The x-axis values then increase steadily, peaking around 3.315. This rise indicates a movement to the right, suggesting a semicircular motion.\n3. **Decrease in Values**: Following the peak, the values decrease back towards the baseline, indicating a transition from a rightward motion to a downward one, possibly denoting a vertical line.\n\n### Y-Axis Analysis\n1. **Initial Stability and Slight Decrease**: The y-axis starts with slight variations, moving from 0.029 to -0.02, indicating a minor downward motion, perhaps the beginning of a curve.\n2. **Increase in Values**: The y-axis values then increase, reaching a peak around 2.059. This upward motion supports the formation of a curve.\n3. **Decrease and Stabilization**: The values decrease and stabilize around 0.039 to 0.069, indicating a return to the baseline and suggesting the end of a vertical motion.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe observed patterns in the x and y axes indicate a combination of circular and linear motions. The initial increase and subsequent stabilization in both axes suggest the formation of a curve followed by a straight line. These movements align with the structural components of the letter \"D,\" confirming that the accelerometer data corresponds to this letter."
