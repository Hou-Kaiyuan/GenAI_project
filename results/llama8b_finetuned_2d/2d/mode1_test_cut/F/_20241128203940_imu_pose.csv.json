The z-axis values remain relatively constant, fluctuating around 9.8 m/sÂ², which is typical for gravitational acceleration. This stability suggests that the motion is primarily two-dimensional, allowing us to focus our analysis on the x and y axes.\n\n#### X-Axis Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Stability**: The x-axis data starts with values around -0.226, indicating a stable or stationary position. This suggests the beginning of a motion sequence.\n\n2. **First Peak and Trough**: The data shows a peak at approximately -0.167 followed by a trough around -0.275. This pattern indicates a downward motion, likely a vertical stroke.\n\n3. **Second Peak and Trough**: A second peak is observed at around 0.069, followed by a trough at -0.422. This sequence suggests another downward motion, possibly a continuation of the first stroke.\n\n4. **Third Peak and Trough**: The data then shows a peak at 0.226, followed by a trough at -0.471. This pattern indicates a third downward motion, potentially completing a vertical stroke.\n\n5. **Final Peak and Trough**: The data concludes with a peak at 0.069 and a trough at -0.167, suggesting a final downward motion.\n\n#### Y-Axis Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Stability**: The y-axis data begins with values around 0.039, indicating a stable position.\n\n2. **First Peak and Trough**: A peak is observed at 1.167, followed by a trough at -2.069. This pattern suggests a horizontal motion, likely a horizontal stroke.\n\n3. **Second Peak and Trough**: A second peak is observed at 4.335, followed by a trough at -2.56. This sequence indicates another horizontal motion, possibly a continuation of the first stroke.\n\n4. **Third Peak and Trough**: The data shows a peak at 4.854, followed by a trough at -2.648. This pattern suggests a third horizontal motion, potentially completing a horizontal stroke.\n\n5. **Final Peak and Trough**: The data concludes with a peak at 3.903 and a trough at -2.648, indicating a final horizontal motion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the accelerometer data reveals a pattern of alternating peaks and troughs in both the x and y axes. The x-axis data shows a sequence of downward motions, while the y-axis data shows a sequence of horizontal motions. This pattern aligns with the structural components of the letter \"M,\" which consists of two vertical strokes and a horizontal stroke connecting them. The data's stability in the z-axis confirms that the motion is primarily two-dimensional, consistent with the formation of the letter \"M.\""
