To begin analyzing the accelerometer data, we first examine the z-axis to determine whether the motion is primarily two-dimensional or three-dimensional. The z-axis values remain relatively constant, hovering around 9.8 m/s², which is consistent with the gravitational acceleration. This stability suggests that the motion is predominantly two-dimensional, allowing us to focus our analysis on the x and y axes.

### Step 2: Analyze the x and y Axes

2. **First Peak**: A significant increase in the x-axis values occurs, peaking at approximately 1.559. This suggests a strong directional movement to the right.
3. **Second Peak**: Following the first peak, the x-axis values decrease, reaching a trough around -1.334. This indicates a reversal in direction, moving leftward.
4. **Stable Region**: After the second peak, the x-axis values stabilize, returning to negative values, suggesting a return to the initial position.
