These values remain relatively constant, fluctuating around 9.8, which is typical for gravitational acceleration. This stability suggests that the motion is primarily two-dimensional, allowing us to focus our analysis on the x and y axes.\n\n#### X-Axis Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Stability**: The x-axis data starts with values around -0.206, indicating a stable position. This suggests the beginning of a motion sequence.\n\n2. **Rapid Increase**: A significant increase in x-axis values occurs, peaking at approximately 3.128. This rapid change indicates a strong directional movement, likely a diagonal stroke.\n\n3. **Decrease and Stability**: Following the peak, the x-axis values decrease, returning to a stable range around -0.206. This pattern suggests a completion of the stroke and a return to the initial position.\n\n#### Y-Axis Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Stability**: The y-axis data also begins with stable values, similar to the x-axis, indicating a starting position.\n\n2. **Increase and Peak**: The y-axis values increase, reaching a peak, which aligns with the diagonal stroke observed in the x-axis data. This increase suggests a vertical component to the motion.\n\n3. **Decrease and Stability**: After the peak, the y-axis values decrease, returning to a stable range, indicating the completion of the vertical component.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe observed patterns in the x and y axes data—initial stability, rapid increase, and subsequent decrease—correspond to the formation of a diagonal stroke followed by a vertical stroke. These movements are characteristic of the letter \"G,\" which consists of a diagonal stroke from top left to bottom right and a vertical stroke from top to bottom. The stable z-axis values confirm that the motion is primarily two-dimensional, aligning with the typical writing motion of the letter \"G.\""
