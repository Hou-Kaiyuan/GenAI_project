These values remain relatively constant, fluctuating slightly around a mean value. This stability suggests that the motion is primarily two-dimensional, allowing us to focus our analysis on the x and y axes.\n\n#### X and Y Axes Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Movement**: The data starts with a slight decrease in the x-axis values, indicating a slight leftward movement. This is followed by a sharp increase in the x-axis values, suggesting a rapid rightward movement. The y-axis values show a slight increase during this period, indicating a slight upward movement.\n\n2. **Peak and Trough**: The x-axis values reach a peak, followed by a trough, which suggests a change in direction. This pattern is consistent with a circular motion, where the x-axis values increase and then decrease as the motion curves.\n\n3. **Stable Region**: After the peak and trough, the x-axis values stabilize, indicating a pause or a change in the motion pattern. The y-axis values also stabilize, suggesting a lack of significant vertical movement during this period.\n\n4. **Final Movement**: The x-axis values then increase again, indicating a final rightward movement. The y-axis values show a slight increase, suggesting a slight upward movement.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe observed patterns in the x and y axes—initial increase, peak and trough, stable region, and final increase—correspond to the structural components of a circular motion. The stability of the z-axis values confirms that the motion is primarily two-dimensional. Therefore, the accelerometer data aligns with the motion of drawing a circle, which is a key feature of the letter \"O.\""
