These values remain relatively constant, fluctuating between 9.8 and 10.2, which suggests that the motion is primarily two-dimensional. This observation allows us to focus our analysis on the x and y axes.\n\n#### X-Axis Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Stability**: The x-axis data starts with values around -0.2, indicating a stable position. This suggests the beginning of a motion sequence.\n\n2. **First Peak**: A significant increase in x-axis values occurs, peaking at approximately 3.8. This indicates a strong horizontal movement to the right.\n\n3. **Second Peak**: Following the first peak, the x-axis values decrease, reaching a trough around -4.1. This suggests a strong horizontal movement to the left.\n\n4. **Return to Stability**: After the second peak, the x-axis values return to a stable range, indicating the end of the motion sequence.\n\n#### Y-Axis Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Stability**: The y-axis data also begins with stable values, similar to the x-axis, indicating the start of the motion.\n\n2. **First Peak**: A notable increase in y-axis values occurs, peaking at around 4.1. This suggests a strong vertical movement upwards.\n\n3. **Second Peak**: Following the first peak, the y-axis values decrease, reaching a trough around -3.8. This indicates a strong vertical movement downwards.\n\n4. **Return to Stability**: After the second peak, the y-axis values return to a stable range, indicating the end of the motion sequence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observed patterns in the x and y axes data reveal a sequence of movements characterized by two distinct peaks. The first peak in both axes indicates a strong upward and rightward movement, while the second peak suggests a strong downward and leftward movement. These patterns align with the structural components of the letter \"U,\" which consists of two vertical strokes connected at the top. The data's fluctuations and peaks correspond to the typical writing motion of the letter \"U,\" confirming that the accelerometer data represents the letter \"U.\""
