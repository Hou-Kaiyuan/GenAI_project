To understand the motion captured by the accelerometer data, we begin by examining the z-axis values. These values remain relatively constant, fluctuating between 9.8 and 10.0, which is typical for accelerometer data when the device is stationary or moving in a 2D plane. This suggests that the motion is primarily 2D, allowing us to focus our analysis on the x and y axes.

#### X-Axis Analysis

1. **Initial Stability**: The x-axis data starts with values around -0.2, indicating a stable position. This suggests the beginning of a motion sequence.

2. **Transition to Positive Values**: The x-axis values then transition to positive, peaking at around 1.8. This indicates a directional change, suggesting a movement to the right.

3. **Return to Negative Values**: Following the peak, the x-axis values return to negative, reaching as low as -1.2. This suggests a reversal of direction, indicating a movement to the left.

4. **Final Stability**: The x-axis values stabilize again, returning to around -0.2, indicating the end of the motion sequence.

#### Y-Axis Analysis

1. **Initial Stability**: The y-axis data also begins with stable values around 0.0, consistent with the initial position.

To understand the motion captured by the accelerometer data, we begin by examining the z-axis values. These values remain relatively constant, fluctuating slightly around 9.8 m/s², which is typical for gravitational acceleration. This stability suggests that the motion is primarily two-dimensional, allowing us to focus our analysis on the x and y axes.

1. **Initial Vertical Motion**: The data starts with a significant decrease in the x-axis values, indicating a downward motion. This is followed by a slight increase in the y-axis values, suggesting a slight rightward movement. These initial changes suggest a vertical motion.

2. **Horizontal Motion**: After the initial vertical motion, the x-axis values show a significant increase, indicating a horizontal motion to the right. This is accompanied by a slight increase in the y-axis values, suggesting a slight upward movement. These changes indicate a horizontal motion.

3. **Return to Vertical Motion**: Following the horizontal motion, the x-axis values decrease again, indicating a return to a vertical motion. This is accompanied by a slight increase in the y-axis values, suggesting a slight rightward movement. These changes suggest another vertical motion.

4. **Final Horizontal Motion**: The x-axis values increase once more, indicating a final horizontal motion to the right. This is accompanied by a slight increase in the y-axis values, suggesting a slight upward movement. These changes indicate a final horizontal motion.

2. **Horizontal Motion**: The x-axis data then shows a series of positive values, indicating a horizontal motion. This is consistent with a stroke or movement across a horizontal plane.

3. **Vertical Motion**: Following the horizontal motion, the x-axis values decrease again, indicating a return to a vertical motion. This pattern suggests a second vertical stroke.

4. **Transition and Completion**: The data shows a transition back to a horizontal motion, followed by a decrease in x-axis values, indicating the completion of the motion.

5. **Y-Axis Patterns**: The y-axis data shows minimal variation, indicating a lack of significant vertical movement. This is consistent with the primary horizontal motion observed in the x-axis data.
