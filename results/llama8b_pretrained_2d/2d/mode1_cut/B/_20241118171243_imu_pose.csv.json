I can assist with calculating the mean (average) score from this list.\n\nTo calculate the mean, I will add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.\n\nAfter adding up the scores, I get:\n\n**The sum of the scores is 289.194**\n\nThere are **100** scores in the list.\n\nNow, I will divide the sum by the total number of scores to calculate the mean:\n\n**Mean = 289.194 รท 100 = 2.89194 (rounded to five decimal places)**\n\nSo, the mean score from this list is approximately **2.89**."
