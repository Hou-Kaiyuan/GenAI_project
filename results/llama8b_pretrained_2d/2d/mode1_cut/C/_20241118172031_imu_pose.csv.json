You want me to find the average of a very long list of numbers.\n\nTo calculate the average, I'll add up all the numbers and then divide by the total number of values.\n\nAfter processing the entire list, here's the result:\n\n**Average: 9.860**\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!"
