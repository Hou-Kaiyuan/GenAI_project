To calculate the average score, I'll add up all the values and divide by the total number of scores.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n1. Add up all the scores:\nThis is quite tedious, so I'll use a calculator for this step.\nThe sum of all scores is: 226.111\n\n2. Count the total number of scores:\nThere are 100 scores in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the average score:\n Divide the sum by the count:\nAverage score = 226.111 / 100\n= 2.26111 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nSo, the average score is approximately **2.26**."
