Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Mean (Average)**: If you're looking for the average score, I can help calculate it.\n2. **Median**: The median is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. This might be helpful if there's a need to understand the central tendency of the scores.\n3. **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. If one score is significantly higher or more frequent than others, it could indicate a notable trend or outlier.\n4. **Range and Standard Deviation**: Understanding how spread out the numbers are can provide insights into variability and consistency within the scores.\n\nPlease let me know which of these or any other analysis you're interested in, and I'll do my best to help!"
