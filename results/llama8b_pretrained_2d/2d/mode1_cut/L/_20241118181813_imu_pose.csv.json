After analyzing the data, here are some key observations:\n\n* The majority of temperatures (around 70%) range from 9.6 to 10.0.\n* There is a small cluster of temperatures around 9.8-9.9.\n* A few outliers exist at the lower end (e.g., 9.6) and upper end (e.g., 10.04).\n* No values are above or below the specified range.\n\nIf you could provide more context about what this data represents, I may be able to offer additional insights or help with further analysis!"
