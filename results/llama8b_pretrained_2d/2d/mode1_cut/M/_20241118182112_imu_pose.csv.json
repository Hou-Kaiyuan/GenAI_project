Add up all the numbers: This is a lengthy process, but I'll do it for you.\n2. Count how many numbers are in the list: There are 100 numbers in the list.\n3. Divide the sum by the count: This will give us the average.\n\nAfter performing the calculation, I get:\n\n**Average:** 9.846\n\nPlease note that this is a very large dataset, and the result might not be particularly interesting or useful without context. If you could provide more information about where these numbers came from or what they represent, I'd be happy to help with any further analysis!"
