However, to provide an accurate response, I would need more context about what these scores represent (e.g., a competition like gymnastics, diving, or another sport) and what specific question or analysis you'd like me to perform on this data.\n\nIf you're looking for basic statistics such as the highest score, lowest score, average score, etc., I can certainly help with that. Please let me know how you would like to proceed."
