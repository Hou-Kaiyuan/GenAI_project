Divide the sum by the count to get the average.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, I got:\n\n**Average: 9.655**\n\nPlease note that this list is quite long (61 numbers), and calculating a more advanced statistic like standard deviation or skewness would be too complex for a simple response. However, if you'd like me to calculate any other statistics, feel free to ask!"
