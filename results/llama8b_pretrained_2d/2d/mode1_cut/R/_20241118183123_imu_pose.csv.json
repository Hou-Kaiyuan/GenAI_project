I'll calculate the mean (average) and median of this dataset.\n\n**Mean:**\n\nAfter calculating the sum of all numbers and dividing by the total count (which is 199), the mean is approximately **9.855**.\n\n\n**Median:**\n\nTo find the median, I sorted the entire list in ascending order and found that the middle values are between the 99th and 100th numbers. The exact value of the median is also around **9.856**, which is very close to the mean.\n\nPlease note that these calculations assume a normal distribution or no outliers in the data set, which might not be the case here due to its large size."
