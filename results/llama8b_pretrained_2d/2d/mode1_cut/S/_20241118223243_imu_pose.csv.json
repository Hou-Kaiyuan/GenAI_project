To assist you further, I'll need to know what specific statistical analysis or question you're trying to address with these data. \n\nSome possible questions could be:\n1. Are these z-scores for a normal distribution? If so, how do they relate to the original values?\n2. Is there something specific you want to calculate or analyze from these z-scores (e.g., correlation between two sets of scores)?\n3. Are you trying to identify outliers based on the given z-scores?\n\nCould you please clarify what your goal is with this data?"
