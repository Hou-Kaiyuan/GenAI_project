I'll assume you want me to perform some statistical analysis on these data.\n\nWhich specific task would you like me to accomplish? Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Correlation between y and z**: Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson's r) between the two lists.\n2. **Regression analysis**: Fit a linear regression model to predict y based on z.\n3. **Summary statistics**: Provide summary statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range, for both lists.\n\nPlease let me know which task you'd like me to perform!"
