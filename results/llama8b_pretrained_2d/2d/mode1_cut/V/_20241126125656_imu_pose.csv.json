Calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between the two lists?\n2. Perform a regression analysis to find the best-fit line between the two lists?\n3. Identify any outliers or anomalies in the data?\n4. Provide summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for each list?\n\nPlease let me know your requirements, and I'll be happy to assist you!"
