However, without specific information on what these numbers represent, it's challenging to provide a meaningful answer.\n\nCould you please clarify the context, such as:\n\n1. What do the two lists represent? Are they related to a statistical analysis?\n2. Which list is the input data, and which one is the output or calculated values?\n\nOnce I understand the context, I can try to assist you better."
