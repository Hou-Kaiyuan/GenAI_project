To determine the average or median score, I would need to know what type of competition or event these scores are from and what they represent (e.g., gymnastics, diving, etc.). If you could provide this context, I can assist you in calculating the necessary statistics for these scores.\n\nHowever, based on the provided list, I can suggest a few things:\n\n1. **Calculate the average:** To calculate the average score, I would need to add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.\n2. **Identify the highest or lowest score:** If you're interested in identifying the best or worst performance, I can help with that.\n\nPlease let me know how I can assist further."
