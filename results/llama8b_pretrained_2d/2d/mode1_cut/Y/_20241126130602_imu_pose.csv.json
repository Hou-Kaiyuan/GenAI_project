To determine the median score, I'll first sort the list in ascending order:\n\n8.895, 8.983, 8.983, 8.993, 9.179, 9.257, 9.316, 9.346, 9.424, 9.454, 9.483, 9.591, 9.591, 9.591, 9.591, 9.607 (implied), 9.66, 9.66, 9.669, 9.699, 9.709, 9.728, 9.758, 9.758, 9.787, 9.797, 9.807, 9.807, 9.816, 9.816, 9.816, 9.816, 9.825 (implied), 9.836, 9.836, 9.836, 9.836, 9.836, 9.836, 9.845 (implied), 9.846, 9.846, 9.846, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.885, 9.885, 9.885, 9.885, 9.885, 9.895, 9.895, 9.905 (implied), 9.915, 9.915, 9.915, 9.924 (implied), 9.944, 9.944, 9.954 (implied), 10.013, 10.013, 10.042, 10.062, 10.126 (implied), 10.136 (implied), 10.169, 10.258, 10.366, 10.397 (implied), 10.408 (implied), 10.513, 10.586 (implied), 10.738, 10.863 (implied), 11.013, 11.739\n\nGiven the large number of scores at 9.865 and 9.885, these are likely candidates for the median.\n\nThe middle value(s) in this list would be around the 50th to 63rd position, as there is a total of 65 unique scores with some appearing multiple times. \n\nSince there are multiple values that could potentially be considered the median due to their frequency and positioning within the dataset, we can consider either score as a potential median.\n\nTherefore, I'll report both scores:\n\n**Potential Medians:**\n\n1. **9.865**\n2. **9.885**\n\nPlease note that without more specific information about how to handle tied values or if there's an expectation for interpolation between these two scores, it's not possible to determine a single definitive median score from the provided list."
