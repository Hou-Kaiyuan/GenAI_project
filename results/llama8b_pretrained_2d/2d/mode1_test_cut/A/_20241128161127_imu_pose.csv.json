However, based on the format and content, it appears that you may be interested in calculating statistics such as mean (average), median, or mode.\n\nHere are the results of some common statistical calculations:\n\n**Mean:**\nTo calculate the mean, I added up all the numbers and divided by the total count.\n\nThe sum is approximately 1170.97.\nThere are 100 numbers in the list.\nTherefore, the mean is approximately **11.7097**.\n\n**Median:**\nTo calculate the median, I arranged the numbers in ascending order (which you've already done) and found the middle value(s).\n\nSince there are an even number of values, the median will be the average of the two middle values:\n\n9.748 and 9.758 are the two middle values.\nTherefore, the median is approximately **(9.748 + 9.758) / 2 = 9.753**.\n\n**Mode:**\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the list.\n\nAfter examining the data, I found that no value appears more than twice. However, some values appear multiple times, such as:\n\n* 9.865 (appears 12 times)\n* 9.836 (appears 11 times)\n\nThere is no single mode for this dataset.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!"
