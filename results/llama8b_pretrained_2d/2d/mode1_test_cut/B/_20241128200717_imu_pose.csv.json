To provide an accurate analysis, I'll need to know the specific type of event (e.g., floor exercise, vault, beam, all-around) and possibly the level of competition (junior, senior, collegiate). Without this information, I can only give you general statistics about the list.\n\nHere are some basic calculations:\n\n**Mean:** 9.836\n**Median:** 9.846\n**Standard Deviation:** 0.184\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to know about these scores (e.g., highest score, lowest score, average score for a particular range)."
