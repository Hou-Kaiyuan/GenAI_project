I'll do my best to provide some insights.\n\nHere are a few things I noticed:\n\n1. **Range**: The smallest number in the list is 8.453 and the largest number is 12.964.\n2. **Distribution**: The numbers seem to be distributed relatively evenly, with no extreme outliers.\n3. **Mean**: To calculate the mean, I'll need to add up all the numbers and divide by the total count. However, this would require a lot of manual calculations or a programming approach.\n\nIf you'd like me to perform any specific analysis (e.g., calculating the mean, standard deviation, or finding patterns), please let me know!"
