I'll do my best to help.\n\nTo get the average score from this list, I'll add up all the numbers and then divide by the total count of numbers.\n\nThe sum of these numbers is:\n\n9.885 + 9.885 + ... (all 120 numbers) = **1147.119**\n\nThere are 120 numbers in the list. To find the average score, I'll divide the sum by the total count of numbers:\n\n**Average Score: 1147.119 ÷ 120 ≈ 9.59762**\n\nPlease note that this calculation assumes all scores are equally weighted and there's no specific context or criteria to consider.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything further?"
