The z-values appear to be a mix of numbers around 9.8 and 9.9.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to help with anything specific, such as:\n\n* Data visualization\n* Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation)\n* Hypothesis testing or confidence intervals\n* Other statistical analyses\n\nI'm here to help!"
