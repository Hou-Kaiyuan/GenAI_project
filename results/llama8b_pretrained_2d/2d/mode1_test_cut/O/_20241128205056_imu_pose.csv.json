        "response": "You've provided a list of scores that appear to be from a gymnastics competition or similar event. To provide an accurate analysis, I'll need to calculate the average score.\n\nHowever, please note that there are several duplicate values in your list. I'll assume these duplicates represent different performances by the same athlete, and I'll only count each unique value once for the purpose of calculating the average.\n\nAfter removing the duplicates, here's a summary of the scores:\n\n**Unique Scores:**\n\n1. 9.758\n2. 9.767\n3. 9.787\n4. 9.807 (x6)\n5. 9.816 (x7)\n6. 9.835\n7. 9.836 (x8)\n8. 9.846 (x6)\n9. 9.865 (x12)\n10. 9.885 (x11)\n11. 9.894\n12. 9.895 (x4)\n13. 9.915 (x7)\n14. 9.934 (x3)\n15. 9.944 (x5)\n16. 9.965\n17. 10.013\n\n**Average Score:**\n\nTo calculate the average score, I'll add up all the unique scores and divide by the number of unique values.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n1. Add up all the unique scores:\n   9.758 + 9.767 + ... + 10.013 = 179.355\n\n2. Count the number of unique scores: 17\n3. Divide the sum of scores by the count of scores:\n   Average score = 179.355 / 17 â‰ˆ 10.53\n\nSo, the average score is approximately **10.53**.\n\nPlease note that this calculation assumes all scores are equally weighted and that there's no bias towards certain score ranges or categories. If you'd like to explore other calculations or provide additional context, I'm here to help!"
