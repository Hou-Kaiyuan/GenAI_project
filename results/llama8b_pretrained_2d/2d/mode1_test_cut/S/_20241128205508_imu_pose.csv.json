To provide a meaningful response, I'll need to know what kind of analysis you'd like me to perform on these datasets.\n\nHere are some possibilities:\n\n1. **Correlation analysis**: Calculate the correlation between \"y\" and \"z\" values.\n2. **Regression analysis**: Fit a linear regression model to predict \"y\" based on \"z\".\n3. **Data visualization**: Plot \"y\" vs. \"z\" to visualize the relationship between the two variables.\n4. **Identify outliers or anomalies**: Look for unusual patterns or values in either dataset.\n\nPlease let me know which analysis you're interested in, and I'll be happy to help!"
