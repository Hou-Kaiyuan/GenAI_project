Values:\n\t* Mean: -0.51\n\t* Standard deviation: 1.24\n2. z-scores:\n\t* Mean: 9.84\n\t* Standard deviation: 0.26\n\n**Correlation between values and z-scores**\n\nIf I calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between the two lists, I get a value of approximately -0.99, which indicates a strong negative linear relationship between the values and their corresponding z-scores.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific questions or if there is anything else I can help with!"
