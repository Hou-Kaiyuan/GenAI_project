I'll assume that you want me to perform some kind of analysis or calculation with these values.\n\nCould you please specify what you would like me to do with these numbers? Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Correlation analysis between the two sets of numbers (y and z)?\n2. Regression analysis to find a relationship between y and z?\n3. Identify any outliers in either set of numbers?\n4. Perform some kind of statistical test or hypothesis testing?\n\nPlease let me know which one you're interested in, or if there's something else you'd like me to do with these numbers!"
