A list of z-values (I assume these are standard scores or z-scores) that correspond to the values in the first list.\n\nTo provide a meaningful answer, I need more context about what you're trying to achieve with these two lists. Are you:\n\n* Trying to find the corresponding z-score for each value in the first list?\n* Wanting to analyze the distribution of values or z-scores?\n* Attempting to identify outliers or patterns in either list?\n\nPlease provide more information, and I'll do my best to assist you."
