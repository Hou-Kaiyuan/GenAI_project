However, I'm a large language model, I don't see any specific question or task related to these numbers.\n\nCould you please provide more context or specify what you would like me to do with these lists? Would you like me to:\n\n1. Calculate statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for the y-values and z-values?\n2. Perform a correlation analysis between the y-values and z-values?\n3. Identify any patterns or trends in the data?\n4. Help with something else?\n\nPlease let me know how I can assist you!"
