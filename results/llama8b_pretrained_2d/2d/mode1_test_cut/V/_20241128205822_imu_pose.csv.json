Can you please tell me:\n\n1. What is the purpose of these numbers? Are they from a statistical analysis, a dataset, or something else?\n2. Do you have any specific questions about the values or z-scores, such as identifying patterns, outliers, or trends?\n\nOnce I understand your context and questions, I'll do my best to provide a helpful response."
