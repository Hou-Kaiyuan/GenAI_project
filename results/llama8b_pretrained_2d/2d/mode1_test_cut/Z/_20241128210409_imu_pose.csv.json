Based on your request to provide an answer \"in English\", I assume you want me to interpret these z-scores.\n\nHowever, without knowing what statistical test or analysis you are performing, it's difficult for me to give a meaningful interpretation. \n\nCould you please clarify the context in which these z-scores were calculated? For example:\n1. Are they from a hypothesis test (e.g., t-test, ANOVA)?\n2. Are they related to regression analysis?\n3. Are they part of a descriptive statistics calculation?\n\nOnce I have more information about your context, I can try to provide an answer in English that makes sense for your specific use case.\n\nIf you're unable to provide more context, please let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist you with the data provided."
