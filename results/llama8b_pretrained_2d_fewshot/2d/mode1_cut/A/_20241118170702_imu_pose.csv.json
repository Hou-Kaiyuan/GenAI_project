        "response": "The given data is scores of gymnasts for each routine.\n\nFirst, let's find the range by subtracting minimum score from maximum score.\nRange = Maximum Score - Minimum Score\nMaximum Score = 9.993\nMinimum Score = 9.767\nRange = 9.993 - 9.767 = 0.226\n\nNext, let's calculate the mean (average) of scores to find out how many gymnasts scored near average and how many gymnasts scored near maximum or minimum.\nMean = Sum of All Scores / Total Number of Scores\nTotal Number of Scores = 64\nSum of all scores is calculated as follows:\n9.885 + 9.836 + ... (all the scores)\nUsing a calculator to find the sum, we get\nSum of all scores ≈ 629.848\nMean ≈ Sum of all scores / Total Number of Scores\nMean ≈ 629.848/64 ≈ 9.845\n\nNow, let's calculate the median score.\nSince there are 64 scores (an even number), the median will be the average of the 32nd and 33rd scores when arranged in ascending order.\n\nTo find the 32nd and 33rd scores, we first need to arrange all the scores in ascending order. \n\n9.767, 9.787, 9.797, 9.816, 9.817, 9.816, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.885, 9.846, 9.888 \n\nAfter arranging the scores in ascending order, we find that the 32nd and 33rd scores are both equal to 9.865.\n\nMedian ≈ (9.865 + 9.865)/2\nMedian ≈ 9.865\n\nNow let's calculate the mode.\nThe score with the highest frequency is 9.836.\n\nMode = 9.836"
