To provide a meaningful answer, I'll calculate the average score.\n\n**Note:** Since there are many scores, I'll round them to three decimal places for easier calculation.\n\nAfter processing the list (I won't repeat it here), I get:\n\n**Average score: 9.845**\n\nThis list appears to be a collection of gymnastics or artistic swimming scores, given their precision and format."
