To find the median, we need to first remove duplicates and then arrange the remaining numbers in ascending order.\n\nHere is the simplified list:\n\n1. 9.66\n2. 9.728\n3. 9.758\n4. 9.767\n5. 9.787\n6. 9.797\n7. 9.806 (closest to 9.807)\n8. 9.816\n9. 9.826 (not present, closest is 9.816)\n10. 9.836\n11. 9.846\n12. 9.865\n13. 9.885\n14. 9.895\n15. 9.915\n16. 9.934\n17. 9.944\n18. 9.964\n19. 10.032\n\nThe number of values is odd (19), so the middle value will be the median. The 10th value is the median:\n\n**Median: 9.836**\n\nHowever, if we need to consider all scores including duplicates for some reason, then the process would be different.\n\nPlease clarify what exactly you're trying to achieve with this data set!"
