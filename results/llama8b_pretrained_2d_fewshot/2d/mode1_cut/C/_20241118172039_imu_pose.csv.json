Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Mean**: If you want the average score, I can calculate it for you.\n\n2. **Median**: If you want the middle value of the scores (when they are sorted in ascending order), I can find that for you.\n\n3. **Highest and Lowest Scores**: If you're interested in knowing the highest and lowest scores in the list, I can provide those as well.\n\n4. **Specific Score Range**: If you'd like to know how many times a certain score appears in the list or want to count scores within a specific range, please let me know.\n\nPlease indicate which of these options you're interested in, or if there's something else you'd like help with!"
