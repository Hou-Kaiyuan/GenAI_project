If you have a specific question or need help with something related to this data, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nHowever, if you'd like, I can provide some general information about how to analyze or work with this type of data. For example:\n\n* You could calculate the mean (average) score to get an overall idea of the team's performance.\n* You could identify the highest and lowest scores to see which routines were particularly successful or struggled.\n* You could group the scores by event (e.g., floor exercise, balance beam, etc.) to compare performance across different disciplines.\n\nLet me know if any of these options are helpful, or if you have a specific question in mind!"
