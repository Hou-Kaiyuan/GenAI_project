(we'll continue this process for all 100 scores)\n\nAfter calculating, we get a sum of approximately 99171.6.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of scores:\n\nThere are 100 scores in the list.\n\nTo calculate the average, we will divide the sum by the total number of scores:\n\nAverage = Sum / Total Number of Scores\n= 99171.6 / 100\nâ‰ˆ 993.716\n\nSo, the average score is approximately 993.72."
