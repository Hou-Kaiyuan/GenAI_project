This reduces the number of values to process.\n2. Then, I will sum up all the remaining unique values.\n3. Next, I will count how many values were in the original list (after removing duplicates).\n4. Finally, I will divide the total sum by the count of values to get the mean score.\n\nHere are the results:\n\nAfter removing duplicate values, there are 57 unique scores in the list.\n\nThe sum of these unique scores is: 544.319\n\nThe mean score is therefore: **544.319 / 57 = 9.564**\n\nPlease note that this calculation assumes that all scores were recorded under the same conditions and have equal weightage. If you need to calculate a specific type of average (e.g., median, mode), or if there are any special considerations for these scores, please let me know!"
