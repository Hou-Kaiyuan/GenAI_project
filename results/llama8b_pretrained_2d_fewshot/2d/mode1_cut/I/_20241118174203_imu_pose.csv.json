Could you please clarify what you are trying to achieve with these numbers? Are you looking for a specific statistical calculation, such as the mean or median, or perhaps some kind of pattern recognition?\n\nAdditionally, there seems to be no obvious relationship between the two sets of numbers (x and z). If you could provide more context or information about what you're trying to accomplish, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.\n\nIf you don't have a specific question in mind, we can explore some general statistical properties of these datasets. For example:\n\n* The range of the x values is approximately 3.0, while the range of the z values is approximately 10.5.\n* The mean of the x values is around -0.2, while the mean of the z values is around 9.85.\n* The standard deviation of the x values is around 1.4, while the standard deviation of the z values is around 0.35.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these insights are relevant to your question or if you have something else in mind!"
