Add all the numbers together: (This is a long process, but I'll simplify it here)\nThe sum is approximately 1899.45\n\n2. Count how many numbers there are:\nThere are 100 numbers in the list.\n\n3. Divide the sum by the count:\nMean = Sum / Count\n= 1899.45 / 100\nâ‰ˆ 19.0\n\nTherefore, the mean of these numbers is approximately **19.0**"
