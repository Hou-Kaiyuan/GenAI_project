The mean is sensitive to outliers, while the median provides a better representation when there are extreme values.\n\nIf you provide more context or specify what you would like to find out from this data (e.g., calculating statistics, identifying patterns, etc.), I'll be happy to assist you further.\n\nHere's some sample Python code that calculates the mean and median of the provided list:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata = [944, 9993, 1016, 12258, 14190, ...]  # paste your entire list here\n\nmean_value = np.mean(data)\nmedian_value = np.median(data)\n\nprint(f\"Mean: {mean_value:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Median: {median_value:.2f}\")\n```\nPlease let me know how I can further assist you."
