To provide an answer, I'll need to know what type of analysis or calculation you'd like me to perform on this data.\n\nHere are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Find the average score**: If you're looking for a summary statistic, I can calculate the mean (average) of the scores.\n2. **Identify the highest and lowest scores**: I can find the maximum and minimum values in the list.\n3. **Explore the distribution of scores**: We could look at the frequency or histogram of the scores to see if there are any interesting patterns.\n4. **Perform a specific calculation**: If you have a particular question in mind (e.g., \"What is the median score?\"), let me know and I'll do my best to help.\n\nPlease let me know which direction you'd like to take with this data!"
