Count the total number of values:\nThere are 90 values in the given list.\n\n2. Add up all the values:\n\nThis step is tedious and prone to errors due to the large amount of data. However, we can simplify it by using a calculator or software for accurate calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the sum:\n\nThe sum of the numbers is approximately: **883.31**\n\n3. Calculate the mean:\nTo find the mean, divide the sum by the total count of values (90).\n\nMean = Sum / Count\n= 883.31 / 90\nâ‰ˆ **9.8464**\n\nSo, the mean of the dataset is approximately **9.85**."
