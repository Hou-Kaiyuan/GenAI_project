Add up all the numbers:\nThis is a very long list of numbers, but I'll do it for you. The sum is: 364.119\n\n2. Count the total number of values:\nThere are 100 numbers in this dataset.\n\n3. Calculate the mean:\n Divide the sum (364.119) by the count (100):\n Mean = 364.119 / 100 = 3.64119\n\nSo, the mean of this dataset is approximately **3.64**.\n\nWould you like me to calculate any other statistics, such as median or standard deviation?"
