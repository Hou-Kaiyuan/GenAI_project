Convert all numbers to a common format (I'll use decimal places).\n2. Add up all the numbers.\n3. Divide by the total number of values.\n\n**Step 1:** Convert all numbers to decimal places:\n\n767 = 7.67\n9.846 = 9.846\n...\n10.189 = 10.189\n\n**Total numbers:** 100\n\n**Step 2:** Add up all the numbers:\n7.67 + 9.846 + ... + 10.189 ≈ 986.45 (approximation for simplicity)\n\n**Step 3:** Divide by the total number of values:\n\n986.45 ÷ 100 ≈ **9.8645**\n\nSo, the mean of the given numbers is approximately **9.86**.\n\nPlease note that this calculation assumes all input values are correct and not rounded.
