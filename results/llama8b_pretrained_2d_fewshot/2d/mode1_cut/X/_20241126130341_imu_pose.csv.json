To analyze this data, I'll calculate some basic statistics and provide insights.\n\n**Summary Statistics:**\n\n1. **Mean:** 9.651\n2. **Median:** 9.698\n3. **Standard Deviation (Ïƒ):** 0.943\n4. **Minimum Value:** 6.992\n5. **Maximum Value:** 14.014\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* The scores range from 6.992 to 14.014, indicating a significant spread.\n* The mean score is 9.651, which suggests that most participants scored around this value.\n* The median score (9.698) is slightly higher than the mean, indicating that there might be some skewness in the data.\n\n**Score Distribution:**\n\nUpon closer inspection, I noticed that:\n\n* There are several scores clustered around the mean and median values (e.g., 9.6-10.0).\n* Some outliers are present, particularly on the high end of the spectrum (e.g., 13.514, 14.014).\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1. **Skewness:** The data appears to be slightly skewed towards higher scores.\n2. **Outliers:** There are a few high-scoring outliers that might affect the mean and standard deviation calculations.\n\nTo further analyze this dataset, I can help with more advanced statistical tests or visualizations if needed!"
