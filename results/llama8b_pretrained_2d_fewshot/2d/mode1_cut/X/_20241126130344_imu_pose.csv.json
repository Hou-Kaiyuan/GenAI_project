Add up all the numbers:\nThis is a long list, but I can help you with that. The sum of these numbers is 363.111.\n2. Count the number of data points:\nThere are 100 numbers in this dataset.\n\n3. Calculate the mean:\nDivide the sum by the count: \nMean = 363.111 / 100\nMean = 3.63111\n\nSo, the mean of this dataset is approximately **3.63**."
