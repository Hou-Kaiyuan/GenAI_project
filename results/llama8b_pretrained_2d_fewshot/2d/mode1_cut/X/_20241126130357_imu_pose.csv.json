I can help you analyze the data or provide some insights if you'd like.\n\nHere are a few things I noticed:\n\n* The highest score is 13.916 and it belongs to a routine that scored 11.042.\n* There is a significant jump in scores at around the middle of the list, with several routines scoring above 10.\n* Many of the routines have similar scores, with some rounds ending in .865 or .846.\n\nIf you could provide more context about what you'd like to do with this data (e.g., find the average score, identify trends, etc.), I can try to help."
