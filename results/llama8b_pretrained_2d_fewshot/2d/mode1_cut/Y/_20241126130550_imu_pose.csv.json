The kernel density estimate (KDE) curve highlights the peak around 9.6.\n\n### Quantiles and Skewness\n\n```python\nprint(df['Scores'].quantile([0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]))\n```\n\n- **Q1 (25th percentile):** Approximately 9.42.\n- **Median (50th percentile):** Around 9.62.\n- **Q3 (75th percentile):** About 9.82.\n\n### Skewness Calculation\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nskewness = np.mean((df['Scores'] - df['Scores'].mean())**3) / df['Scores'].std()**3\nprint(\"Skewness:\", skewness)\n```\n\nThe skewness value is slightly positive, indicating a rightward skew.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis dataset contains scores with most values clustered around 9.6, showing a moderate spread and slight rightward skew."
