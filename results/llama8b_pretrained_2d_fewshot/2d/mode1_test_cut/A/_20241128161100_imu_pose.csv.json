To provide an answer, I'll need more context about what these scores represent and what you would like me to do with this list (e.g., calculate the mean, median, mode, etc.). If you could provide additional information or clarify your question, I'd be happy to help.\n\nHowever, based on the format of the data, it seems like you might be looking for a calculation such as:\n\n1. **Mean**: The average score.\n2. **Median**: The middle value when the scores are sorted in ascending order.\n3. **Mode**: The most frequently occurring score.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these calculations or another task would be helpful, and I'll do my best to assist you."
