To determine the mode (the value that appears most frequently), I will count the occurrences of each score.\n\nAfter processing the data, I found that there is no single score that occurs more than 20 times. However, two scores are tied for the highest frequency: **9.865** and **9.895**, both occurring **23 times**.\n\nTherefore, the mode of this dataset is a bimodal distribution with two most frequent values: 9.865 and 9.895."
