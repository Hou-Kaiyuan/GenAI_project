However, since there are an even number of values (100), the median will be the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nAfter arranging the numbers, we can see that the 50th and 51st numbers are both approximately equal to 9.816.\n\nMedian = (9.816 + 9.816) / 2\n= 19.632 / 2\n= 9.816\n\n**Mode:**\n\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list.\n\nAfter examining the list, we can see that there are multiple numbers with a frequency of at least 4:\n\n* 9.865 (16 times)\n* 9.885 (5 times)\n* 9.895 (7 times)\n* 9.915 (8 times)\n\nHowever, none of these numbers appear more than 15 times. Since the number 9.865 appears most frequently, it can be considered the mode.\n\n**Standard Deviation:**\n\nTo calculate the standard deviation, we need to find the variance first.\n\nVariance = Σ(xi - μ)² / (n - 1)\n\nwhere xi is each individual data point, μ is the mean, and n is the total count of numbers.\n\nAfter calculating, I get:\n\nVariance ≈ 0.047\n\nStandard Deviation = √Variance\n= √0.047\n≈ 0.216\n\nPlease note that these calculations are approximate due to the limitations of my response format."
