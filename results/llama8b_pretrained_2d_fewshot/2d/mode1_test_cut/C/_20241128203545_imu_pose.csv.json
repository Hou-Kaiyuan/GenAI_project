To provide an answer, I'll need to know the relationship between these two lists or what type of analysis you'd like me to perform on them (e.g., correlation, regression, etc.). Without more context, it's challenging to provide a meaningful response.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for some basic statistics, here are a few:\n\n**List x:**\n\n- The minimum value is -3.491.\n- The maximum value is 0.549.\n- The mean (average) of the list is approximately -0.485.\n- The standard deviation is about 1.185.\n\n**List z:**\n\n- The minimum value is 9.522.\n- The maximum value is 10.219.\n- The mean (average) of the list is approximately 9.853.\n- The standard deviation is about 0.243.\n\nPlease provide more context or clarify what you're trying to analyze, and I'll do my best to assist you further."
