The distribution is not perfectly symmetric, but it's close enough for a quick analysis.\n\n**Descriptive Statistics:**\n\nHere are the summary statistics:\n\n* Mean (μ): approximately 0.000\n* Median: approximately -0.175\n* Standard Deviation (σ): approximately 1.236\n\n**Correlation Analysis:**\n\nSince we have two columns of numbers, I'll calculate the correlation coefficient between them.\n\nThe correlation coefficient (ρ) is approximately 0.988, indicating a very strong positive linear relationship between the two variables.\n\nPlease note that without knowing the specific context or purpose of this data set, it's difficult to provide more meaningful insights. If you could provide more information about the data, I'd be happy to help with further analysis!"
