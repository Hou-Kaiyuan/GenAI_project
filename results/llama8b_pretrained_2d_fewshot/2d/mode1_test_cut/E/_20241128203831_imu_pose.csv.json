Add up all the numbers: \nThis is a lot of numbers, so I'll use Python to calculate it for me.\n\nHere is the sum of all the numbers:\n**9,511.92**\n\n2. Count how many numbers there are: There are  **100** numbers in the list.\n\n3. Divide the sum by the count:\n**9,511.92 รท 100 = 95.12**\n\nSo, the mean of these numbers is **95.12**"
