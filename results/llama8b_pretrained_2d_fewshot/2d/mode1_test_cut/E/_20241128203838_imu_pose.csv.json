Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. **Calculate the mean (average) score**: I can calculate the average value in the list.\n2. **Find the highest and lowest scores**: I can identify the maximum and minimum values in the list.\n3. **Detect outliers**: If there are any extremely high or low values that stand out from the rest of the data, I can help you identify them.\n4. **Perform statistical analysis**: Depending on your needs, I can perform more advanced analyses like calculating standard deviation, variance, skewness, or kurtosis.\n\nWhich one of these options interests you, or do you have a different question in mind?"
