        "response": "To calculate the median of a list of numbers, we need to first arrange them in ascending order and then find the middle number. If there are an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nHere's how I can help:\n\n1. **Sorting:** Let's sort your long list of numbers from lowest to highest.\n2. **Finding the Median:** After sorting, we'll check if the total count of numbers is odd or even. If it's odd, the median will be the number right in the middle. If it's even, the median will be the average of the two central numbers.\n\nPlease note that since your list is already given, I can proceed with these steps directly.\n\nSorting and analyzing 103 values as provided:\n\nAfter sorting the values, we find that the total count of numbers is odd (103). The middle value in this case is the 52nd number. \n\nThe median value from your list is **9.836**."
