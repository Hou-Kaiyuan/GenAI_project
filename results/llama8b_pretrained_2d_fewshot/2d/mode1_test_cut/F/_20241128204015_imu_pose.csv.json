Mean:\n   - Sum of all values: 6275.111\n   - Count of values: 102\n   - Mean: **61.673** (rounded to three decimal places)\n\n2. Standard Deviation:\n   - Variance = Σ(xi - μ)^2 / N, where xi is each value, μ is the mean, and N is the count.\n   - Calculating variance... \n   - Variance ≈ 23.41\n   - Standard deviation (SD) = √Variance ≈ **4.84**\n\n**Results:**\n- The mean of this dataset is approximately 61.673.\n- The standard deviation is approximately 4.84.\n\nPlease note that these values are rounded to three decimal places for simplicity."
