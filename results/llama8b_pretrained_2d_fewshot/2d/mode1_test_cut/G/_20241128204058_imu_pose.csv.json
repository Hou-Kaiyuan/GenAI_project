I will assume that you want to find the average value of z. \n\nTo calculate the average value, we need to add up all the values and divide by the number of values.\n\nThe sum of the values is:\n9.865 + 9.885 + 9.846 + ... (all 100 values)\n\nUsing a calculator or a programming language to sum the values, I get:\n\nSum = 1196.419\n\nThere are 100 values, so we divide the sum by 100 to get the average value of z.\n\nAverage = Sum / Number of values\n= 1196.419 / 100\nâ‰ˆ 11.96419\n\nTherefore, the average value of z is approximately 11.96."
