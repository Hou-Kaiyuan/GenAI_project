Could you please specify what kind of analysis or question you would like me to perform on this data? Are you looking for:\n\n1. Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation)?\n2. Correlation between the two variables?\n3. Identification of patterns or trends in the data?\n4. Something else?\n\nPlease let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you!"
