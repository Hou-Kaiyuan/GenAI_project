Can you please provide some additional details or clarify the problem you're trying to solve?\n\nIf you're looking for a simple statistical analysis, such as calculating means or standard deviations for each list, I can help with that. Alternatively, if you have a specific mathematical or programming-related question, feel free to ask!"
