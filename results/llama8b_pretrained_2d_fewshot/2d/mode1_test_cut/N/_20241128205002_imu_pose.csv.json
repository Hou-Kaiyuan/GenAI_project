To analyze this data, I'll need to calculate some statistics.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n1. **Mean**: 2.535\n2. **Median**: 2.295\n3. **Standard Deviation (Ïƒ)**: 1.855\n4. **Range**: 10.287 - (-0.059) = 10.346\n5. **Variance**: 3.451\n\nThe z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. A positive z-score indicates that the element is above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates that it's below.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n* Most data points have z-scores close to 0, indicating that they are near the mean.\n* There are some outliers with high positive z-scores (e.g., 10.14, 9.964), which suggests that there are a few values significantly higher than the mean.\n* The lowest z-score is -0.059, which is relatively close to 0.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to calculate any additional statistics or explore these results further!"
