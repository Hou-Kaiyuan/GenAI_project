We will calculate the mean of this list by summing all the numbers and dividing by the total count of numbers.\n\n## Step 3: The second list also contains numerical values within a similar range as the first list. Again, we will calculate its mean by summing all the numbers and dividing by the total count of numbers in this list.\n\n## Step 4: To find the mean of the first list, we need to add up all the numbers and divide by the count of numbers. This requires us to perform a series of additions and then divide by the total number of values.\n\n## Step 5: Similarly for the second list, we will add up all its numbers and divide by the count of numbers in this list.\n\n## Step 6: After calculating the mean of both lists, we can compare these values to see if there's any significant difference between them.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
