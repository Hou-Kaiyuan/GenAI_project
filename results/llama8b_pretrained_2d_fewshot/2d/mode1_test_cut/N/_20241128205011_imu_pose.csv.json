I'll assume that you want to perform some statistical analysis or find the relationship between these two sets of data.\n\nHowever, without a clear question or context, it's difficult for me to provide a specific answer. Could you please clarify what you're trying to achieve with this data? Are you looking for:\n\n1. Correlation coefficient?\n2. Regression analysis?\n3. Statistical summary (mean, median, standard deviation)?\n4. Something else?\n\nPlease provide more information or context about the problem, and I'll do my best to assist you."
