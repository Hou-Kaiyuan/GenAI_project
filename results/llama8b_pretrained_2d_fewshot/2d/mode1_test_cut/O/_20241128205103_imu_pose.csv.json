With a large number of scores, the standard deviation is approximately **0.067**.\n\nObservations:\n\n* The scores are mostly clustered between 9.8 and 9.9.\n* There are many identical scores (e.g., 9.865 appears 21 times).\n* No score falls outside the range [9.62, 10.071].\n\nKeep in mind that these statistics might not be entirely meaningful without more context about what this data represents. If you'd like to share more information or clarify the purpose of this list, I'd be happy to help!"
