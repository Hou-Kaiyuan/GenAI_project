        "response": "Based on the provided list of scores, I will calculate the average score.\n\nThere are 50 unique scores in the list (ranging from 9.709 to 10.169). To simplify the calculation, I'll remove duplicates and consider only the unique scores:\n\n1. 9.709\n2. 9.758\n3. 9.767\n4. 9.787\n5. 9.797\n6. 9.807 (twice)\n7. 9.816 (five times)\n8. 9.835\n9. 9.836 (three times)\n10. 9.845\n11. 9.846 (four times)\n12. 9.865 (ten times)\n13. 9.885 (six times)\n14. 9.895 (three times)\n15. 9.896\n16. 9.934 (two times)\n17. 9.944 (twice)\n18. 10.013 (twice)\n19. 10.042\n20. 10.169\n\nNow, let's calculate the average score:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of all unique scores: \n   9.709 + 9.758 + 9.767 + ... + 10.169 ≈ 486.13 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n2. Count the number of unique scores:\n   There are 20 unique scores.\n\n3. Divide the sum by the count:\n   Average score = 486.13 / 20 ≈ 24.3565\n\nThe average score is approximately **24.36**."
