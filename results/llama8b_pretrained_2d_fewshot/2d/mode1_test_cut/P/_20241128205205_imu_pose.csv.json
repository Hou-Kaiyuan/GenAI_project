10.003\n8. 10.004\n9. 10.005\n10. 10.006\n11. 10.007\n12. 10.008\n13. 10.009\n14. 10.01\n15. 10.011\n16. 10.012\n17. 10.013\n18. 10.014\n19. 10.015\n20. 10.016\n\nSince there are an even number of values, the median is the average of two middle numbers. In this case, we have:\n\n(10 + 10.001) / 2 = 10.0005\n\nSo the median value is approximately **10.0005**."
