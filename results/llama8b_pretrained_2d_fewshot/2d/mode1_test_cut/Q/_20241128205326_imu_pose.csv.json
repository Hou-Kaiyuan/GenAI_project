If there's an even number of entries, it will be the average of the two middle values.\n3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the list.\n\nLet me know which one you're interested in, or if you have any other specific question!\n\nHere are some results:\n\n* Mean: approximately 9.53\n* Median: approximately 9.79\n\nPlease let me know what else I can help with!"
