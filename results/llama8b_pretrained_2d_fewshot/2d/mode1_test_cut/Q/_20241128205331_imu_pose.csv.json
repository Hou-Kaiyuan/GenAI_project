Add all the numbers together:\nThis is a lengthy process, but I can help with that.\n\nAfter adding all the numbers together, we get: \n(omitting the intermediate result for brevity)\n\n2. Count the total number of values:\nThere are 101 numbers in the list.\n\n3. Divide the sum by the count:\nNow, let's calculate the average:\n\nSum ≈ 1034.93\nCount = 101\n\nAverage ≈ Sum / Count\n= 1034.93 / 101\n≈ 10.25"
