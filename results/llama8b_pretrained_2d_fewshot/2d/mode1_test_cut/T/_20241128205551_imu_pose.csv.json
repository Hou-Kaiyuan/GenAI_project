I'll need more context or a specific task to assist you accurately.\n\nHowever, based on the content of these lists, it seems they might be related to statistical analysis, particularly concerning z-scores and possibly data normalization or comparison. If you could provide more details about what you're trying to achieve (e.g., calculating correlations, identifying outliers, understanding distribution properties), I'd be happy to assist with the appropriate steps and calculations.\n\nPlease confirm if there's a specific problem or question related to these datasets that you'd like help solving."
