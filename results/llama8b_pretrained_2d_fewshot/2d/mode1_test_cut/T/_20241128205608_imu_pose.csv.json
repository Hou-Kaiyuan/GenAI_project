I'll assume that these are datasets from a statistical analysis.\n\nPlease clarify what you'd like to know about this data, such as:\n\n1. Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation)?\n2. Correlation or regression analysis between x and z?\n3. Identifying outliers or anomalies in the dataset?\n4. Something else?\n\nOnce I understand your question, I'll do my best to provide a helpful response."
