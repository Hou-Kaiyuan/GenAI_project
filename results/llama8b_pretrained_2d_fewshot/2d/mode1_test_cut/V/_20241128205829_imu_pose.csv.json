Therefore, the median of Set 1 is:\n\n(1.451 + 1.491) / 2 = 1.471\n\n**Set 2:**\n\nThe numbers are sorted in ascending order:\n9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, 9.865, ...\nSince there is an even number of values (34), the median will be the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nThe two middle numbers are 9.865 and 9.885. Therefore, the median of Set 2 is:\n\n(9.865 + 9.885) / 2 = 9.875\n\nNow, let's compare the medians:\n\nMedian of Set 1: 1.471\nMedian of Set 2: 9.875\n\nThe median of Set 2 (9.875) is significantly larger than the median of Set 1 (1.471)."
