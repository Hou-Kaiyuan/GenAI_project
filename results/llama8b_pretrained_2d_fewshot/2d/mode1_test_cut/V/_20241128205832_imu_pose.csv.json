If so, here is how you can do it:\n\n```r\n# Find the numbers with a z-score of 9.865\nresult <- df %>% filter(z_score == 9.865)\nprint(result$data)\n```\n\nThis will return all the numbers that have a z-score of exactly 9.865 in your dataset.\n\nIf there's something else I'm missing or if you could provide more context about what you are trying to achieve, please let me know!"
