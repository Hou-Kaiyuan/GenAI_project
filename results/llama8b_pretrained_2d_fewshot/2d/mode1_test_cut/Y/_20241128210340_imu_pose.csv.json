I will calculate the mean (average) and median of these numbers for you.\n\n**Mean:**\nTo calculate the mean, I'll add up all the numbers and divide by the total count:\n\nTotal sum: 362,551.45\nTotal count: 120\n\nMean: 3029.29 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n**Median:**\nSince there are 120 numbers in the list (an even number), the median will be the average of the middle two numbers when the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a sorted version of the list:\n\n... (omitted for brevity)\n\nThe 60th and 61st numbers in the sorted list are: 9.865 and 9.846\n\n Median: (9.865 + 9.846) / 2 = 9.8555 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nPlease note that these calculations assume the list is a random collection of numbers and not part of any specific statistical analysis or problem. If you have any further questions or context about this list, feel free to ask!"
